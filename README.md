# Idea of this exercice
All branches of biological sciences use the analysis technique known as gel electrophoresis. Gel electrophoresis provides information on the relative sizes of the fragments, which is helpful for restriction mapping and PCR fragment analysis.
# Requirements
We need to follow the next steps: Take an arbitrary DNA sequence from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology), between 1000 and 3000 nucleotides, take 10 random samples from this sequence, between 100-3000 bases and simulate the migration of these DNA segments on the electrophoresis gel, based on their molecular weights using a visual representation.
